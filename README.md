FlorkWeezz is vulnerablity scanner developed in python

<br>

## 🔍  𝐭𝐚𝐬𝐤 <br>
The vulnerability scanner code performs the following task

1- 𝐒𝐜𝐚𝐧𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐭𝐚𝐫𝐠𝐞𝐭: <sp> It uses the 'nmap' library to scan a specified target ip address for opening ports and to detect services and operating system running that ports.


2- 𝐃𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐕𝐮𝐥𝐧𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐛𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐞𝐬: <sp> After scanning the target , the code iterates through the scan results to identify potential vulnerabilities. In the provided example, it checks if the detected services match specific criteria.

3- 𝐆𝐞𝐧𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚 𝐑𝐞𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭: <sp> Once the scanning scanning and vulnerability detection are complete, the code generates a report summarizing the scan result.
